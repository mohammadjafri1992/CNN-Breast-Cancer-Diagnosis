# CNN-Breast-Cancer-Diagnosis

This project tries to solve a real world problem of detecting early stage breast cancer. Breast cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer and its early detection can help us save thousands of lives annually. 

I used a deep learning technique, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which is primarily used for image and video processing. Video processing is one of the most common applications of CNNs as it is the "eyes and ears" of a Self-Driving Car.
